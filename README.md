## Description 
This project was to build a password generator that inculed numbers, symbols, upper and lower case letters. I had to use if else statments and arrays to map everything out to make everything work together. 


## Challenges
This project was pretty challenging to me. I understood a lot of it until I got to the end and I could not figure out why I kept getting all of my numbers,letters, and symbols coming back in the box. Over all it was a fun project to see how I could push myself and see what all can be done with javascript.
